               Puzhal Lake, also known as Red Hills Lake, is a rain-fed reservoir near Chennai that serves as a major water source for the city. Constructed in the 19th century by the British, it is a popular spot for nature lovers, offering a serene environment for sunrise and sunset views. The lake's full capacity is 3,300 million cubic feet and it includes a historical tower, Jone Tower, built in 1881 to measure water levels.
